# Hi there 👋

I am currently a Computer Science master student at ETH Zurich. I would be very interested to do a PhD in one of the following areas: Computer Engineering, Cryptography, Communication or Hardware Security.

## 🎯 Interests

- Programming in C, Java and Python. Programming hardware (Verilog) and in Assembly raised my interest, however I have very little experience. [I did this course and the assignments in Spring 2025](https://safari.ethz.ch/ddca/spring2025/doku.php?id=schedule).
- Embedded systems (currently playing with espressif esp32)
- Desktop applications (JavaFX)
- some other stuff...

## 🎓 Education
- Bachelor of Science in informatics (major information systems)
- Master of Science in informatics (major secure and reliable systems)
- PhD? Who knows! It would be nice though.
