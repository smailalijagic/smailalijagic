# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently an informations systems student at the University of Zurich doing my final semester of my Bachelor studies. In Fall 2025 I will start my Master in computer science at ETH Zurich. I would be very interested to do a PhD in one of the following areas: Computer Engineering, Cryptography, Communication or Hardware Security.

## ðŸŽ¯ Interests

- Programming in C, Java and Python. Programming hardware (Verilog) and in Assembly raised my interest, however I have very little experience. [I did this course and the assignments in Spring 2025](https://safari.ethz.ch/ddca/spring2025/doku.php?id=schedule).
- Embedded systems (currently playing with espressif esp32)
- Desktop applications (JavaFX)
- some other stuff...

## ðŸŽ“ Education
- Bachelor of Science in informatics (major information systems)
- Master of Science in informatics (major secure and reliable systems) starting in 2025
- PhD? Who knows! It would be nice though.

## Some Project Ideas
Feel free to do them on your own.

- Building a desktop application, where you can import pdf, word and txt files. Using the app you can decide wether that document is relevant or not. If relevant copy it to a keep folder, if not relevant do not copy it to the keep folder. If you are unsure that document should be inserted back into the pile of documents at a random position.
- File finder: building a desktop application that can iterate through every possible folder on your computer and finds the file that contains that name.
- Quotes of the Day: A mobile application where users can post every 24 hours one inspirational quote. Quotes can be stored and shared to other users. Users can follow each other...
- Building a small desktop application for cost tracking of a project (instead of using Excel).
